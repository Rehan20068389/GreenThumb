Contribution to the project:

I actively contributed to the design, development, and testing of the GreenThumb hybrid mobile application. My responsibilities included setting up the Apache Cordova project structure, configuring the Android platform, and integrating required plugins such as the Camera and Geolocation plugins. I was involved in writing and organizing the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to ensure the application was user-friendly, touch-friendly, and consistent across screens.

I also contributed to configuring the splash screen and application icons suitable for the Android platform. Additionally, I assisted in testing the application on an Android emulator/device to verify that all features worked correctly without errors. I participated in debugging issues related to plugin functionality and ensured that the final build met the assessment requirements outlined in the module brief.

Overall, I worked collaboratively with my group member(s) and contributed equally to the successful completion of the project.
